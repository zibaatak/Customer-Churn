## Overview

Welcome to the E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction project! Our objective is to analyze and predict customer churn, 
a critical challenge for businesses striving to retain their valuable clientele. By harnessing the power of data-driven insights,
the aim is to offer strategic suggestions to minimize churn rates and enhance customer retention strategies.

## Data

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a comprehensive view of customer attributes and behaviors that influence churn within 
the e-commerce domain. Each data point is a window into the dynamics of customer engagement, revealing key aspects that impact 
their loyalty and satisfaction. Here's a breakdown of the dataset's essential components:

E Comm CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer in the dataset.
E Comm Churn: A churn flag indicating whether a customer has churned or not.
E Comm Tenure: The duration of the customer's association with the e-commerce organization.
E Comm PreferredLoginDevice: The preferred device for customer logins.
E Comm CityTier: The tier of the city where the customer resides.
